# 03-Text-adventure
This is my first text adventure game, and my second ever video game. It has four directions, which is two more than a line: What more could you want?

I premised the world on a shittier verison of Glasgow. Everything is very desolate and the narrator is snarky. There is no 'Win condition' or 'End condition' so the game just asks you to walk around in circles and enjoy the narration, of which there's probably around ~150 words. 

To be overly candid: This assignment is due the same week of several other major projects and in spite of the fact I love writing I could only afford so much time to it.
